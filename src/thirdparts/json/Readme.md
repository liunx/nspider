# JSON
A one-pass JSON parser with no memory overhead with no memory copying or
allocating. The implementation is very simple but should parse any valid
json input, but trades validation for efficency.
One pass of the parser only reads up to the first depth of value
and pair(key,value), but deeper levels can be reached with the parsed output.
The general concept is based on [js0n](https://github.com/quartzjer/js0n) but
implements a different API. In addition the origin of the nice test macros can be
found in [vec](https://github.com/rxi/vec).

## Features
    - written in C
    - small (~250 loc)
    - no allocation
    - utf8 support
    - minimal validation

## Prerequisites
To build and use the JSON parser you only need to drop the two
Source files into your project and offer the following
build environment:
* GCC or clang compiler

## Usage
First the json parser iterator needs to be created by using
the `json_begin` function which takes a utf8 string + length in bytes
and returns the newly created iterator.

```c
struct json_iter iter;
iter = json_begin(json, len);
```
To further parse the JSON file there are two functions.
First the `json_read` function which reads in the next token
and returns the next iterator. `json_read` main purpose is reading
array values and providing the base for the next function.

```c
struct json_token tok;
iter = json_read(&tok, &iter);
```
The second parse function `json_parse` is for name + value pairs
and uses the `json_read` function internally to read in two tokens.
`json_parse` takes an iterator and a `json_pair` as arguments and
returns the next iterator.

```c
json_pair pair;
iter = json_parse(pair, &iter);
```
To access the string in the token or token pair there are two utility functions.
The first function `json_dup` takes a read token and a allocator callback and
returns a newly allocated string which contains the parsed string.
```c
json_char *str;
str = json_dup(&tok, malloc);
```
The second function `json_cpy` takes a read token and a buffer with a maximum
size to copy into and returns the number of bytes that have been copied.
```c
json_char buf[BUF_SIZ]
int size = json_cpy(buf, BUF_SIZ, &tok);
```
The last three utitlity function are `json_cmp`, `json_type` and `json_num`.
`json_cmp` compares a token with a given string pointer and returns if these two are equal.
```c
const json_char buf[] = "token";
int eq = !json_cmp(&tok, buf);
```
`json_type` returns the type of a given token, but as well as the main parsing
function does not perform extensive validation of content.
```c
const enum json_typ t = json_type(&tok);
```
Last but no least `json_num` converts a read token into a number that
is provided as an argument and returns JSON_NUMBER on success. Not all JSON number representation can
be converted. As for now the conversion is limited on integers (`[0-9]*`) and simple
fraction (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*`).
```c
json_number num = 0;
int res = (json_num(&num, &tok) == JSON_NUMBER);
```
